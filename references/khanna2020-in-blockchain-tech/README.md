abstract="Revolutions in technology in past few decades have generated complete transformations in natural orthodox processes owned by industry, education and healthcare, disrupting work flow processes and generating out of box solutions and processes. Industry 4.0 has increased the demand for revolutionary changes in education and pedagogical approach in education. Engineering education is directly affected by the revolutionary demand of industry. Disruptive technology has directly affected all the core branches: Mechanical, electrical, electronics, civil engineering. Exponentially evolving technological innovations are described as Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous and to make students industry ready, changes in engineering curriculum are required. The current work is sincere effort to analyze the issues and challenges required in all branches of engineering for industry 4.0. The objective of the work is to analyze and identify the major disruptive technology with their influential effect on core engineering branches. The work also discusses the necessary changes required to incorporate concept of engineering 4.0.",
